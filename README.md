Clarity (v2): The Modern, Moddable Platformer! (WIP)

Ok, Ok. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "What happened to the old Clarity?", which is a fair question. I'll answer that quickly: After a game engine rework, Clarity (Legacy) is now an archived project and will not recieve any further updates.

## What is Clarity?

Clarity is a platformer game engine for the future. It allows for the simple creation of 2d platformer games using simple, high-level javascript in a format called a "mapvar".

## Okay, but what *is* a mapvar?

A mapvar is a self-contained game. It contains textures, scripts, physics definitions, and much, much more. Mapvars can be published on the Workshop, and can then be played and reviewed by the community. The mapvar docs can be found [here]().

### This page is still under construction.

The new editor is currently availible for betatesting!
